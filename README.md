# Photo-Editor

This program takes an image as input and outputs a lightly edited copy. It is implemented into a very simple website used to decompose the given image into a matrix, each pixel being given three values (RGB).

*This program was created in the framework of my studies at UDEM

# What I learned 

* Implementing java code inside an HTML website
* Basic image edition through image-matrix decomposition
